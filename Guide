This repository contains several examples of proof by parameterised coinduction.

These examples compile with Coq 8.9 and require opam and paco to be installed through opam.


Paco can be installed by performing the following in a terminal:
opam repo add coq-released https://coq.inria.fr/opam/released
opam install coq-paco
